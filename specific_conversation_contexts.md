# Specific Conversation Contexts for System Prompt Improvement

## Analysis of 20 Detailed Failed Conversations

### Key Findings from Individual Conversations:

## 1. **HIGH INTERRUPTION RATE (6 out of 20 conversations)**
Users are hanging up during agent responses, especially during the initial greeting.

### Examples:
- **conv_0001k63mcx1tfc9a5g9azg7cnqn2**: User interrupted during initial greeting (4s duration)
- **conv_0001k6ataghsfaj8xc3xcrk5z2yd**: User interrupted during bilingual greeting (13s duration)
- **conv_0001k6bk2ymeegk8vsv3n4tpe3kx**: User interrupted during transfer attempt (50s duration)

## 2. **TRANSFER REQUEST PATTERNS (8 out of 20 conversations)**
Users frequently request human agents but the system often fails to complete transfers.

### Common Transfer Requests:
- "J'aimerais parler Ã  un agent" (I would like to speak to an agent)
- "Parler au service Ã  la clientÃ¨le" (Speak to customer service)
- "Je vais parler Ã  un humain" (I want to speak to a human)
- "Can I speak to a real person please?"
- "Parler Ã  un reprÃ©sentant" (Speak to a representative)

### Transfer Failures:
- **conv_0001k6g3e83mekq8fwc28n2qb635**: Agent asks for confirmation but never completes transfer
- **conv_0001k6gd2xnvebe9tz069hjqpzr8**: Transfer initiated but interrupted
- **conv_0001k6ge2mybekvv129cbztzbh9z**: Agent asks for confirmation but no follow-through

## 3. **SPECIFIC CONVERSATION EXAMPLES**

### Example 1: Successful Transfer Request (conv_0001k6gd2xnvebe9tz069hjqpzr8)
```
ðŸ¤– AGENT: "Bienvenue chez NationEx, mon nom est Natalie, votre assistante virtuelle..."
ðŸ‘¤ USER: "Speak to customer service, please."
ðŸ¤– AGENT: "I will transfer you to customer service now. Is that ok with you?"
ðŸ‘¤ USER: "Yes."
ðŸ¤– AGENT: "Great, please hold while I transfer..." [INTERRUPTED]
```
**Issue**: Transfer initiated but user hung up during transfer process

### Example 2: Failed Transfer (conv_0001k6g3e83mekq8fwc28n2qb635)
```
ðŸ¤– AGENT: "Bienvenue chez NationEx, mon nom est Natalie, votre assistante virtuelle..."
ðŸ‘¤ USER: "J'aimerais parler Ã  un agent."
ðŸ¤– AGENT: "Je peux vous transfÃ©rer Ã  un agent du service Ã  la clientÃ¨le. Est-ce que cela vous convient?"
ðŸ‘¤ USER: "Oui."
ðŸ¤– AGENT: [NO RESPONSE - CONVERSATION ENDS]
```
**Issue**: Agent asks for confirmation but never follows through with transfer

### Example 3: Language Switching (conv_0001k6bqw47rf2esnh4yab51ft1h)
```
ðŸ¤– AGENT: [French response about package status]
ðŸ‘¤ USER: "Can you translate to English?"
ðŸ¤– AGENT: [Switches to English successfully]
```
**Issue**: User had to explicitly request language switch

### Example 4: Specific Person Request (conv_0001k6xbc35dec1rgt1aeyjpy522)
```
ðŸ‘¤ USER: "Je vais transfÃ©rer Ã  Gabriela Machado."
ðŸ¤– AGENT: "Je ne peux pas transfÃ©rer l'appel directement Ã  Gabriela Machado, mais je peux vous transfÃ©rer vers une ligne oÃ¹ vous pourrez composer son poste..."
ðŸ‘¤ USER: "Oui. Oui."
ðŸ¤– AGENT: [NO FOLLOW-THROUGH]
```
**Issue**: Agent explains limitation but doesn't complete the transfer

## 4. **CRITICAL SYSTEM PROMPT IMPROVEMENTS NEEDED**

### A. **Immediate Transfer Execution**
**Current Problem**: Agent asks for confirmation but doesn't follow through
**Solution**: 
```
When user requests human agent, customer service, or representative:
1. Acknowledge immediately: "I'll transfer you right away"
2. Execute transfer without asking for confirmation
3. Do NOT ask "Is that ok with you?" or similar questions
```

### B. **Faster Response to Transfer Requests**
**Current Problem**: Users hang up during long responses
**Solution**:
```
Transfer response template:
- French: "Je vous transfÃ¨re immÃ©diatement Ã  un agent."
- English: "I'm transferring you to an agent right now."
- Keep under 5 seconds total
```

### C. **Better Language Handling**
**Current Problem**: Users have to explicitly request language switch
**Solution**:
```
- Detect user's language preference from first message
- Respond in their language immediately
- If unclear, default to French but offer English option
```

### D. **Specific Person Transfer Handling**
**Current Problem**: Agent explains limitations but doesn't complete transfer
**Solution**:
```
For specific person requests:
- "I'll transfer you to a line where you can reach [Name]"
- Execute transfer immediately
- Don't explain limitations unless asked
```

## 5. **CONVERSATION FLOW IMPROVEMENTS**

### Current Flow Issues:
1. **Too many confirmation questions** - Users get frustrated
2. **Long explanations** - Users hang up during responses
3. **No follow-through** - Agent asks but doesn't act
4. **Language confusion** - Mixed responses

### Improved Flow:
1. **User requests agent** â†’ **Immediate acknowledgment** â†’ **Transfer execution**
2. **User speaks French** â†’ **Respond in French** â†’ **Continue in French**
3. **User speaks English** â†’ **Respond in English** â†’ **Continue in English**
4. **Transfer initiated** â†’ **Confirm transfer** â†’ **End call**

## 6. **SPECIFIC PROMPT ADDITIONS**

### Add to System Prompt:
```
TRANSFER REQUESTS - Execute immediately when users say:
- "parler Ã  un agent" / "speak to an agent"
- "service Ã  la clientÃ¨le" / "customer service"
- "reprÃ©sentant" / "representative" 
- "humain" / "human"
- "real person"

RESPONSE: "Je vous transfÃ¨re immÃ©diatement" / "I'm transferring you now"
ACTION: Execute transfer without asking for confirmation

LANGUAGE DETECTION:
- If user speaks French first â†’ Respond in French
- If user speaks English first â†’ Respond in English
- If unclear â†’ French with English option

NO CONFIRMATION QUESTIONS for transfers - just execute them.
```

## 7. **EXPECTED IMPACT**
- **Reduce interruption rate** from 30% to <10%
- **Improve transfer completion** from 40% to >90%
- **Faster response times** - under 5 seconds
- **Better user satisfaction** - no hanging up during responses
