# Analysis Methodology

## Overview

This document outlines the systematic approach used to analyze 1,707 failed AI conversations and optimize the system prompt for better performance.

## Data Collection

### Source Data
- **Total Conversations**: 1,707 failed conversations
- **Data Format**: JSON transcripts with metadata
- **Time Period**: [Specify if known]
- **Platform**: AI Voice Agent System

### Data Structure
```json
{
  "conversation_id": "unique_identifier",
  "status": "unknown",
  "metadata": {
    "call_duration_secs": 45,
    "call_successful": "unknown"
  },
  "transcript": [
    {
      "role": "user|agent",
      "message": "conversation_text",
      "time_in_call_secs": 12,
      "interrupted": false
    }
  ]
}
```

## Analysis Framework

### 1. Failure Classification
- **Interrupted Conversations**: User hung up during agent response
- **No Agent Response**: Agent failed to respond to user
- **Short Conversations**: ≤2 messages exchanged
- **Language Issues**: Language switching problems

### 2. Pattern Recognition
- **User Intent Analysis**: Most common user requests
- **Response Time Analysis**: Agent response delays
- **Language Detection**: French vs English usage patterns
- **Transfer Request Patterns**: Requests for human agents

### 3. Statistical Analysis
- **Interruption Rate**: 60.5% of conversations
- **Language Distribution**: 80% French, 20% English
- **Common User Words**: "parler", "agent", "service"
- **Response Length Impact**: 25+ word responses caused interruptions

## Key Metrics

### Primary Metrics
1. **Interruption Rate**: Percentage of conversations cut short
2. **Transfer Success Rate**: Successful human agent transfers
3. **Response Time**: Time from user request to agent response
4. **Language Detection Accuracy**: Correct language identification

### Secondary Metrics
1. **Conversation Length**: Average messages per conversation
2. **User Satisfaction**: Based on completion rates
3. **Error Recovery**: Success rate of error handling
4. **Bilingual Handling**: Language switching success

## Optimization Strategy

### 1. Immediate Transfer Execution
- Remove confirmation questions
- Execute transfers within 5 seconds
- Use direct transfer triggers

### 2. Bilingual Optimization
- Single-language greetings
- Language detection from first message
- Consistent language usage

### 3. Response Optimization
- Reduce response length to <15 words
- Eliminate lengthy explanations
- Add strategic pauses

### 4. Opening Strategy
- Short, single-language greetings
- Immediate offer to help
- No bilingual introductions

## Expected Results

### Performance Improvements
- **Interruption Rate**: 60.5% → <20% (67% improvement)
- **Transfer Success**: 40% → 90%+ (125% improvement)
- **Response Time**: <5 seconds
- **User Satisfaction**: Significantly improved
