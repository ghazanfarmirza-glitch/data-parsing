## üéØ Quick Start Guide

### **Step 1: Access Failure Data**
1. Go to: [https://elevenlabs.io/app/agents/history?agent=agent_5801k0x0n8vkfxs9z19e1n060hvr&result=failure](https://elevenlabs.io/app/agents/history?agent=agent_5801k0x0n8vkfxs9z19e1n060hvr&result=failure)
2. Review the list of failure conversations
3. Note the total number of failures and time range

### **Step 2: Analyze Individual Failures**
1. Click on each failure conversation
2. Review the transcript and analysis
3. Identify the specific failure point
4. Document the user intent and agent response

### **Step 3: Identify Patterns**
1. Categorize failure types
2. Look for common user intents that fail
3. Find recurring agent response issues
4. Note any tool execution failures

## üìä Analysis Checklist

### **‚úÖ Basic Metrics**
- [ ] Total failure conversations count
- [ ] Time range of failures
- [ ] Failure rate percentage
- [ ] Most recent failures

### **‚úÖ Failure Pattern Analysis**
- [ ] Interruption rate (users hanging up)
- [ ] Empty response rate (agent not responding)
- [ ] Tool failure rate (getShipment, transfer tools)
- [ ] Language handling issues
- [ ] Transfer request failures

### **‚úÖ User Intent Analysis**
- [ ] Most common user requests that fail
- [ ] Shipment tracking failures
- [ ] Transfer request failures
- [ ] Language switching issues
- [ ] Edge case scenarios

### **‚úÖ Agent Response Analysis**
- [ ] Where agent responses fail
- [ ] Common response patterns in failures
- [ ] Tool execution issues
- [ ] Confirmation loop problems
- [ ] Error handling gaps

## üîç Specific Test Cases to Look For

### **1. Invalid Shipment ID Cases**
Look for conversations where users provided:
- **"123"** - Simple numeric string
- **"abc123"** - Alphanumeric string
- **"123!@#"** - Special characters
- **Empty input** - No shipment ID provided
- **"123 456 789"** - Spaces in ID

**Expected Behavior**: Agent should reject invalid formats and explain correct format
**Failure Indicator**: Agent accepts invalid input or doesn't explain format

### **2. Transfer Request Cases**
Look for conversations where users requested:
- **"J'aimerais parler √† un agent"** - French transfer request
- **"Speak to customer service"** - English transfer request
- **"Je veux parler √† [Specific Person]"** - Specific person transfer
- **Transfer requests outside office hours**

**Expected Behavior**: Agent should confirm and complete transfer
**Failure Indicator**: Transfer not completed, confirmation loops, or office hours issues

### **3. Language Switching Cases**
Look for conversations with:
- **Mixed language input** - "Je veux track mon shipment"
- **Language switching mid-conversation** - User switches from French to English
- **Bilingual responses** - Agent mixing languages

**Expected Behavior**: Smooth language detection and switching
**Failure Indicator**: Confused language handling or inconsistent responses

### **4. Edge Cases**
Look for conversations with:
- **Interruptions** - User hanging up during agent response
- **Empty responses** - Agent not responding
- **Tool failures** - getShipment tool not working
- **System errors** - Technical issues

**Expected Behavior**: Graceful error handling and recovery
**Failure Indicator**: Agent not handling edge cases appropriately

## üìã Data Collection Template

### **For Each Failure Conversation:**

```
Conversation ID: [ID]
Date/Time: [Timestamp]
Duration: [Duration in seconds]
User Intent: [What user was trying to do]
Agent Response: [What agent said/did]
Failure Point: [Where the conversation failed]
Issues Identified: [List of specific issues]
Category: [Interruption/Transfer/Language/Tool/Other]
Priority: [High/Medium/Low]
```

### **Example Entry:**
```
Conversation ID: conv_1234567890
Date/Time: 2025-10-15 14:30:00
Duration: 45 seconds
User Intent: "track shipment 123"
Agent Response: "I'll check that for you... [uses getShipment tool] [ERROR]"
Failure Point: Tool execution failed
Issues Identified: Invalid shipment ID accepted, tool error not handled
Category: Tool
Priority: High
```

## üéØ Analysis Framework

### **1. Categorize Failures**
- **Interruption Failures** - User hung up
- **Transfer Failures** - Transfer requests failed
- **Tool Failures** - getShipment or other tools failed
- **Language Failures** - Language handling issues
- **Edge Case Failures** - Unusual scenarios not handled

### **2. Identify Root Causes**
- **Prompt Issues** - Agent instructions unclear
- **Tool Integration Issues** - Tools not working properly
- **Configuration Issues** - Settings not optimal
- **Edge Case Handling** - Unusual scenarios not covered

### **3. Prioritize Fixes**
- **Critical** - Core functionality not working
- **High** - Major user experience issues
- **Medium** - Moderate impact issues
- **Low** - Minor improvements

## üìä Expected Findings

Based on our previous analysis of 1,707 failed conversations, expect to find:

### **High Interruption Rate (60.5%)**
- Users hanging up during agent responses
- Long greetings causing early hang-ups
- Confusing or unhelpful responses

### **Transfer Request Failures (~30% success)**
- Confirmation loops without completion
- Office hours issues
- Transfer logic problems

### **Language Handling Issues (~10%)**
- Bilingual greetings causing confusion
- Poor language detection
- Inconsistent language usage

### **Tool Execution Failures (~15%)**
