## 🔍 Expected Failure Patterns (Based on Previous Analysis)

Based on our analysis of 1,707 failed conversations, we expect to find these patterns in your deployed agent:

### **1. High Interruption Rate (Expected: 60.5%)**
- **Pattern**: Users hanging up during agent responses
- **Root Cause**: Long greetings, slow responses, or confusing content
- **Impact**: High abandonment rate

### **2. Transfer Request Failures (Expected: ~30% success)**
- **Pattern**: Users requesting human agents but transfers failing
- **Root Cause**: Confirmation loops, office hours issues, or transfer logic problems
- **Impact**: User frustration and escalation

### **3. Language Handling Issues (Expected: ~10%)**
- **Pattern**: Poor language detection and switching
- **Root Cause**: Bilingual greetings, inconsistent language usage
- **Impact**: Confused users, poor experience

### **4. Tool Execution Failures (Expected: ~15%)**
- **Pattern**: getShipment tool failures, invalid input handling
- **Root Cause**: Poor input validation, tool integration issues
- **Impact**: Failed core functionality
