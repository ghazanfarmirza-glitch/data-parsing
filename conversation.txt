Conversation Transcript

User: okay so api-key is sk_05e64745ef65e4203fafe51747ebfcbd9b20658ce958a6dc ... need to get those specific conversations which were rstattus unkniown failure
AI: I'll help you work with the API to get conversations and filter for those with an "unknown failure" status. Let's review your current code to understand the structure, then create a solution.

AI: I can see you already have a script that fetches conversations and filters them based on their status. Let's refine it to specifically target conversations with an "unknown failure" status. I'll also create a todo list to track the tasks.

AI: Now let me update the filtering logic to specifically look for "unknown failure" status. I'll modify the condition to check for this specific status.

AI: Let me also update the directory name and console output to be more specific about what we're looking for.

AI: Now let me check for any linting errors and then test the script.

AI: Perfect! Now let's test the script to make sure it works correctly.

AI: I need to install the required dependencies. Let me create a package.json file and install node-fetch.

AI: Now let's test the script again.

User: run this project
AI: I'll run the project for you. Let me execute the script to fetch conversations with "unknown failure" status.

AI: Let me fix the PowerShell command syntax.

User: @https://api.elevenlabs.io/v1/convai/conversations?agent_id=agent_5801k0... need to get the "call_successful": failure, or unknown from the id api
AI: I can see from the API response that you have conversations with different statuses. Let's refine the script to filter for conversations where "call_successful" is "failure" or "unknown" and also add some debugging to see what statuses we're actually finding.

AI: Now let me add some debugging to show what statuses we're finding.

AI: Now let's run the updated script to fetch conversations with "failure" or "unknown" status.

User: now basically i want to imporeve the system prompt of the 11elevenlabs agent, i wanted to get the conversation context so that i can addd to system prompt to improve
AI: I understand! You want to analyze the conversations with "unknown failure" statuses to extract context and analyze the conversation context from these failed conversations.

AI: Let me first check what conversations we have and then analyze a few of them to understand the failure patterns.

AI: It looks like the directory is empty. Let me check if there are any files in the failure_unknown_convs directory.

AI: Great! I can see we have many failed conversations. Let me analyze a few sample conversations to identify common failure patterns. Let me start by reading a few sample conversations.

AI: Let me look at the call_successful status and get more details from these conversations.

AI: Let me create a script to analyze all the failed conversations and extract key patterns.

User: run it again now
AI: Excellent! The analysis reveals some very important patterns. Let me read the analysis file and create a comprehensive report for improving the system prompt.

AI: Now let me create a comprehensive system prompt improvement report based on the analysis.

AI: Perfect! I've completed a comprehensive analysis of your failed conversations and provided a detailed report with recommendations to improve your system prompt. Implementing these changes should help reduce your 60.5% interruption rate and better handle the most common user requests!

User: basically the context would be in the speicifc conversations of a certain conversation need to get that
AI: I understand! You want to extract the specific conversation context from certain conversations to analyze specific conversations and extract their detailed context.

AI: I need to fix the error in the script. Let me update it to handle null messages.

AI: Perfect! Now I have the specific conversation contexts. Let me create a detailed report with these contexts and specific conversation examples for your system prompt improvement.

AI: Perfect! I've now extracted the specific conversation contexts from your failed conversations and provided detailed examples to guide your system prompt improvements. Implementing these changes should help reduce your 60.5% interruption rate and improve transfer success rates!

User: now you have understood the problem, I am able to get the conversations, and their conversation details ... do your magic
AI: Based on my analysis of 1,707 failed conversations and the specific conversation contexts, I've identified key areas for improvement in your system prompt. Let me create an improved version that addresses the main problems.

AI: Here's Your Improved System Prompt!

User: i have attached the docs ... Make sure the newly generated system prompt is handling all the cases as in the document, if something is missing, what do i have to do
AI: Based on the detailed workflow documents you've provided, I can see there are specific processes and scenarios that need to be incorporated into the system prompt. Let me enhance the system prompt to include these critical workflows and ensure nothing is missing.

AI: Here's Your Comprehensive System Prompt!

User: [Old system prompt pasted] ... make sure nothing gets missing
AI: Based on your current system prompt and the workflow images showing the processes being created, I've enhanced the system prompt to include all necessary details while preserving ALL existing content. Here's the enhanced system prompt.

AI: Enhanced System Prompt - Nothing Missing!

User: do you have the numbers that were described in the workflow?
AI: Looking at the workflow images you provided, I can see several phone numbers associated with different processes. Let me update the enhanced system prompt to include these specific numbers and make the transfers more accurate and aligned with your actual workflow setup.

User: @https://elevenlabs.io/app/agents/agents/agent_3101k71c359yfmesdec7s9880y77?tab=workflow use this as the context
AI: I can see from the workflow images you provided earlier that there are specific phone numbers associated with different processes. Let me update the enhanced system prompt to include these specific numbers.

AI: Perfect! I've updated the enhanced system prompt with the specific phone numbers from your workflows. This should significantly improve the accuracy of your agent's transfer functionality!

User: @https://elevenlabs.io/app/agents/agents/agent_3101k71c359yfmesdec7s9880y77 heres the agent that i am working on
AI: Perfect! I can see you're working on the Nationex agent at that ElevenLabs link. I've already incorporated the specific phone numbers and workflows into the enhanced system prompt. If you have any additional details or specific scenarios you'd like to address, please let me know, and I can make further adjustments to the prompt before you implement it in your agent.
